# Dynamic World Concept

Main idea based on "Dynamic World Design By Alun Hancock": let's make a world that lives and evolves by itself without bunch of scipted events that centered around player.

> The purpose of a dynamic world is for events and changes to take place, logically, without any
> players being present in the game. Quests are not generated from a set script or by selection from a
> random list. They are created by the progression of natural events in the game world.



## Interesting ideas to implement

* evolution and genetics
* economics simulation
* information spreading (rumors, reputation, religion etc...)
* laws and crimes
* politics (game of thrones, long live the queen)
* gods interventions, blessings, curses (black & white)
* the prophecies, predictions and fortune-telling (based on precalculations of N next years in high deterministic system)
* global changes in landscape, climate
